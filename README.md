OptodeConversion_Rscript
========================

This R function is useful for converting phase and temperuture values from Presens PSt3 optodes into %O2 saturation using previously recorded calibration values. Required inputs to the function are the phase and temperature during measurement, as well as the phase and temperuture for the sensor calibrated to 0% O2 saturation and 100% O2 saturation. The function output provides a dataframe including the %O2 saturation. More details are provided at www.nate-miller.org/blog/presens-optode-conversion-phase-into-saturation-using-r-function
